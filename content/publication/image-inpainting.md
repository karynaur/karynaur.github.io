abstract = "This extended abstract presents the first stages of a research in inpainting suited for art reconstruction. We introduce MC Escher’s Print Gallery lithography as a use-case example. This artwork presents a void on its center and additionally, it follows a challenging mathematical structure that needs to be preserved by the inpainting method. We present our work so far and our future line of research."
