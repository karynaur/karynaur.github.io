            Hi, I'm Aditya Srinivas Menon, a recent computer science graduate with a keen interest in pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence to make a positive impact. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for solving complex problems across machine learning, natural language processing, and cross-lingual research.

            <h1>Education</h1>
            I graduated with B.Tech with Hons. from IIIT Kottayam, maintaining a CGPA of 9.01/10. My honours thesis was based on developing a novel approach to cross-lingual phrase retrieval using deep learning techniques under the guidance of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/manumadhavancka/home">Dr. Manu Madhavan</a>. My final year project was study on building web-based verb thesaurus for Sanskrit, a low-resource language in India. This work was done under the guidance of <a href="https://www.iiitkottayam.ac.in/#!/faculty/nandini">Dr. Nandini J.Warrier</a>. My courses in college also included machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, statistics and probability.

            <h1>Industry and Research experience</h1>

            My internships at Begin.ai, Bosch India and AdPushUp have given me a taste of the real-world applications of AI. I had the wonderful oppurtunity to be guided by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/drkonjengbamanand/home">Dr. Konjengbam Anand</a>, who taught me a lot about research, cross-lingual NLP and low-resource languages, which led to the internship at IIT Dharwad and publications at SPECOM'23 and ICDMAI'22. I worked with <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html">Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann</a> from University of Hamburg, Germany, on Interpretable Sentiment Analysis models for low-resource languages. I also spent the summer of 2023 working on end-to-end Person Reidentification pipeline with <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/deepak.mishra">Dr. Deepak Mishra</a> during an internship at Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST).

            <br><br>
            When I'm not diving into complex algorithms, I am actively involved in mentoring, organizing technical events, and supporting underrepresented groups in STEM.
